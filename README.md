# Dark Matter
A cold, dark & frosty theme.
> This is a modified remake of the original Dark Matter theme by [cosmicsalad](http://github.com/cosmicsalad/) (AKA Hammock).
> The modification made to the remake was to change the darkness of the black tones since the theme loads that element from a URL.

## Credits
* Hammock for making the original theme.
* Devilbro for giving me permission to use his BlurpleRecolor theme. This saved a lot of time.
